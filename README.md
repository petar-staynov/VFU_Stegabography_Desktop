# Image Steganography Application
WFP desktop image steganography program for Windows 64-bit based on .NET Core 3.1

## What does it do?
It allows users to hide a secret message in a bitmap (.bmp) image. The message can optionally be encrypted with a password for extra security.

## How does it work?
1. Loop through every pixel of the image
2. Get the value of every color channel (Red-Green-Blue) and clear its last bit (least significant bit) by filling them with 0 (zero)
3. Take a character from the user input message string and convert it to an 8-bit integer
4. Hide 1 bit of this inetegr into every color channel for the next 3 pixels - R1, G1, B1, R2, G2, B2, R3, G3
5. After processing the 8 bits of the character, move to the next one and repeat from step 3.
6. To mark the end of the text, write 8 consecutive zeroes (in the next 24 pixels). This will be used when reading the message.
